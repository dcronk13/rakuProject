# RakuProject
This project uses Raku and regex pattern matching to extract, edit and clean a list comprised of thousands of song entries. Part of the functionility includes extracting titles, cleaning punctuation, and building new song names based on the most common word pairs. This project was a great introduction to Perl and Raku, and served as a good exercise in programming for edge cases.
